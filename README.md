data cleaning
This repository contains my Day 1 task for Elevate Labs. The objective was to clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset to make it ready for analysis.

The cleaning process involved:

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Standardizing column names and text formats

Parsing and formatting dates

Extracting and transforming duration values

Outlier treatment (example: capping extreme movie durations)

netflix_titles_cleaned.csv → Final cleaned dataset
netflix_titles.csv → Before cleaning dataset
copy.py → code for data cleaning
